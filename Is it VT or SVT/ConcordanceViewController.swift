This is illustrated in actual ECG tracings above. In panel A all the complexes are a monophasic R (also called positive concordance); in panel B all the complexes are a monophasic QS (also called negative concordance). In panel C the complexes are a monophasic R in V1 - V5 and QS in lead V6, and not diagnostic of VT. Only the presence of a measurable RS complex or its absence in the precordial leads is helpful.")
